    "\n",
    "Street name attributes are stored as key-value pairs with key = \"addr:street\" tagging the attribute as an information container for a street name and value = \"any name\" defining the actual name of the street. \"addr:street\" is stored in second level elements tag.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there is no concise terminology or convention for naming streets in german-speaking countries (e.g. Switzerland). Sometimes they can be written in two words, where one Noun is joined with a \"typical\" street category (Strasse -street-, Platz -square-, Allee -avenue-, Weg -way-), as in \"Mainzer Strasse\", which implies the meaning \"in honor of\" (street named in honor of the City Mainz). However, two words can be combined to name a street, without any of the words describing a typical street category (e.g, \"Oberere Weid\", \"Hinter Z端nen\") or even more than two words can be used to name a street (e.g, \"An der Halde\"). In both cases -without street category extension- the name simply has an inherent geographic description for that particular street. E.g, \"Oberere Weid\" means that the street is located next to a high-altitude meadow or atop a mountain/hill, as in \"Am Berg\". As if this isn't complicated enough, basically the same street name can be written in multiple variations depending on regional specifications. E.g, \"Obere Weid\", \"Ober Weid\", \"Obere Weide\", \"Obere Weiden\" are all valid street names in Switzerland/Germany. So with respect to the latter example, you can't be sure that \"Weid\"/\"Weiden\" is a misspelling of \"Weide\"!\n",
    "Additionally, street names can consist of one-word trivial names that are inherently ambiguous. E.g., \"Vorstadt\" is a valid street name in Zurich but the word literally translates to \"suburb\". Moreover, each of the above mentioned two-word variants are existent as one-word combinations, such as \"Holzweid\" or \"M端ssmattstrasse\". In fact, one-word street names are the most common variant!!  \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the most significant issue in terms of identifying any wrong spelling or abbreviations  in street names, is the lack of standardized naming pattern, e.g with street types as distinct words separated from the rest of the name, which is the standard for UK/ american street names (e.g \"7th avenue\"). On the one hand, this fact makes it necessary to use basic regular expression checks to screen for misspelling or abbreviations for street types, which on the other hand, impedes extraction of different types of abbreviations or misspelling, as for instance using \"st\" as a regex check to identify \"-str\"/\"-strrasse\"/\"-stasse\", without mostly and wrongly extracting valid street names, such as \"Kirchenstiege\" (by using st in a regular expression check)!! This is even more of an issue for street types having, for instance \"Allee\" or \"Weg\"  in their names, as the combination of vowel-consonant/consonant-vowel, if using \"al or we\" as a regular expression check, is vastly present in valid street names (\"Waldgass\", \"Waltikon\" and many many more would be returned as invalid). The bigger the dataset, the more apparently invalid street names will be returned, which at some point makes automated auditing obsolete!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "So I developed following strategy to identify most of invalid street name entries without returning too many false negatives and, thus, making the analysis very cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each of the expected street types, check for word-character insertions (e.g, insertion of \"a\" in \"Plaatz\"). Including insertions of characters not present by default in the name (e.g \"e\" in \"Pleatz\") would require a much more sophisticated approach, which I am not yet capable of implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check for abbreviations or deletion.  \n",
    "-For each of the names in the expected street types set, use the first two characters to define a regular expression  (e.g, \"st\" to find M端ssmattstr. or M端ssmattstrase).  \n",
    "-allow 3 additional word-characters to follow the two-letter regular expression for all expected street types but \"strasse\". For \"strasse\" allow up to 4 additional word-characters (simply because \"strasse\" is the string with most leters).\n",
    "-restrict the regular expression check to search for a match at the end of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "I make the assumption that insertions include only characters from which the street type name is constructed of (e.g \"p,l,a,t,z\" in \"Plaatz\" with \"a\" insertion), simply by pressing a key twice by mistake. Separating auditing for misspelling by insertion and deletion/abbreviation,  allows for a more stringent search of deletions, because I can reduce the number of word-characters following the two-letter regular expression. As such, I assume to overall minimize the number of false positives (e.g regex check using \"st\" would return \"Rostlaubenweg\" -valid name-, if more than 4 additional word-characters are allowed in the expression) without missing too many true positives (regex matching misspelling of street type).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Furthermore, 4 cities with state extension other than state (Canton) of Zurich  were found, e.g \"Muri (AG)\", a city located in the state of Aargau.

As already noticed, many of those wrong entries simply refer to the state of Zurich instead of being restricted to the city of Zurich! Based on this explicit mistakes, I strongly assume that many street names are included that actually don't belong to the street set of the city of Zurich!! For first level elements (node, way, relation) having tags specifying street names, city names and postcodes, respectively, it is basically unclear which entries are actually right or wrong in terms of validity (just the postcode, or both postcode and city, or is the street located outside the city boundaries of Zurich city?). \n",

I am thinking of restaurants offering voucher for meals/drinks to anyone who makes updates on the dataset that would provide the most relevant information about the cognate restaurant (street name, postcode, district and quarter affiliation, opening hours, cuisine, average price for meals, etc.). This would be attractive especially for people living nearby a restaurant (or at least in the same quarter/district), as the benefit of getting free meals/discounts could prevail the effort for conducting an update (assuming basic computer knowledge). The restaurants could try to stimulate overall contributions by offering really valuable benefits (expensive meals, meals for two people, etc.) as the overall costs would still be very low, in contrast to extremely high marketing value.  \n",

    "Screening for mistakes, , abbreviations, language variants in street names turned out to be more difficult than expected. The reason is that german street names don't follow a distinct naming pattern, including street types as independent words within the name. Instead a large number of streets has arbitrary names. Especially with growing size of data, the number of false negatives is increasing, which at some point will compromise the developed strategy, because false negatives will prevail.  \n",
    "The other major issue was the presence of data points that actually don't belong to the selected dataset (here, the city Zurich in Switzerland). However, once being aware of this, one can easily implement a strategy to either select and mark those data points, or even exclude them from the final database."
